## Download

Prebuilt versions are published on GitHub Releases:

- [Latest release page](https://github.com/Ceceliaee/patina/releases/latest)

If you just want to use the app, open the latest release page and download the `.exe` installer.

For browser webpage sync, the release also includes the Patina Web Sync extension, with usage instructions inside the extension package.

## Why Patina

- Automatic foreground app tracking without manually maintaining the main time record.
- AFK, lock, sleep, and crash recovery boundaries designed to keep records trustworthy.
- Local SQLite storage by default, with no account, cloud sync, or server dependency.
- App-level controls for names, categories, colors, stats exclusions, and title capture.
- Lightweight local tools for reminders, timers, and Pomodoro.
- A restrained, low-interruption desktop interface for long-term daily use.

## Core Features

### Automatic Tracking

- Detects the active foreground window and application.
- Prevents idle time from silently counting as effective activity.
- Seals sessions across lock, sleep, long-away, and abnormal-exit boundaries.
- Uses media and audio signals to reduce missed time in low-interaction scenarios such as videos, meetings, courses, and livestreams.

### Review And Analysis

- Review today's effective activity, app ranking, category distribution, and live tracking status.
- Browse the daily timeline and inspect title details under the same app.
- Explore trends, heatmaps, and app-level curves across longer time ranges.

### Management And Control

- Rename apps and adjust categories or colors.
- Exclude apps from statistics or disable title capture for specific apps.
- Export local backups, restore backups, and clean up historical records.

### Lightweight Tools

- Create one-off reminders and app usage limit reminders.
- Use stopwatch, countdown, and Pomodoro for active focus tasks.
- Tool state stays local and does not replace automatic tracking records.

## Reliability And Privacy

Time tracking has long-term value only when the records are trustworthy. Patina focuses on these boundaries:

- **Native window tracking**: identifies the foreground window through Rust and the Windows API.
- **AFK-aware timing**: idle time does not continue counting as effective activity.
- **Lifecycle boundaries**: handles lock, sleep, resume, and abnormal-exit session sealing.
- **Noise filtering**: filters installers, updaters, temporary system windows, and similar processes that should not enter statistics.
- **Real-duration stats**: rankings, distributions, and totals use effective activity time, not just visual spans.
- **Title capture control**: window title capture can be disabled per app to reduce unnecessary sensitive information retention.
- **Local data control**: core data stays local, and backups or restores are initiated by the user.

## Current Scope

Patina intentionally keeps its scope focused:

- **Windows 10/11 first**
- **Personal use first**
- **Local-first data storage and control**
- **Quiet, professional, long-term desktop experience**
- **Lightweight local tools such as reminders, timers, and Pomodoro**

Team collaboration, account systems, cloud sync, mobile apps, broad multi-platform parity, task management platforms, gamified productivity tools, and heavy AI insights are not the current main direction.

## Support

Patina is a personal, local-first open-source project. If it has been useful in your daily life or work, you can support ongoing maintenance in whichever way is convenient:
